# Home

Welcome to KronosBoard! If this is your first time here, please take some time to read through this documentation before you begin using the protocol. This documentation is intended to take you through the entire process of how to get started using KronosBoard to earn stable, high yields that are only possible through the power of DeFi. Let's dive in!

## Why KronosBoard

KronosBoard is based upon the work of the brilliant tomb.finance project.

## What are the KronosBoard protocol tokens?

Bomb Moneyâ€™s multi-token protocol currently consists of the following four tokens, and each plays a critical role in how the protocol works to maintain peg:

* **KDOLLAR** Tokens ($**KDOLLAR**) - The **KDOLLAR** token is designed for use as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol aims to maintain **KDOLLAR**'s peg to 1 **BUSD** in the long run.

* **KDOLLAR Shares ($KSHARE)** - **KDOLLAR** Shares (**KSHARE**) are one of the ways to measure the value of the **KDOLLAR** Protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to maintain **KDOLLAR** close to peg. During epoch expansions the protocol mints **KDOLLAR** and distributes it proportionally to all **KSHARE** holders who have staked their tokens in the Boardroom (Masonry ). **KSHARE** has a maximum total supply of 70000 tokens distributed as follows:&#x20;
  1. Team Allocation: 7000 KSHARE vested linearly 12 months&#x20;
  2. DEV Allocation: 2500 TSHARE vested linearly over 12 months&#x20;
  3. Remaining 59500 TSHARE are allocated for incentivizing Liquidity Providers in two shares pools for 12 months

* **KDOLLAR** Bonds (**KBOND**) main job is to help incentivize changes in **KDOLLAR** supply during an epoch contraction period. When the **TWAP** (Time Weighted Average Price) of **KDOLLAR** falls below 1 **BUSD**, **KBOND**s are issued and can be bought with **KDOLLAR** at the current price. Exchanging **KDOLLAR** for **KBOND** burns **KDOLLAR** tokens, taking them out of circulation (deflation) and helping to get the price back up to 1 **BUSD**. These **KBOND** can be redeemed for **KDOLLAR** when the price is above peg in the future, plus an extra incentive for the longer they are held above peg. This amounts to inflation and sell pressure for **KDOLLAR** when it is above peg, helping to push it back toward 1 **BUSD**.
