Welcome to KronosBoard! If this is your first time here, please take some time to read through this documentation before you begin using the protocol. This documentation is intended to take you through the entire process of how to get started using KronosBoard to earn stable, high yields that are only possible through the power of DeFi. Let's dive in!

## Why KronosBoard

KronosBoard is based upon the work of the brilliant tomb.finance project. Pegging price to the KRONOS will be cause of keeping high KRONOS price.

## What are the KronosBoard protocol tokens?

Bomb Moneyâ€™s multi-token protocol currently consists of the following four tokens, and each plays a critical role in how the protocol works to maintain peg:

* **KDOLLAR** Tokens ($**KDOLLAR**) - The **KDOLLAR** token is designed for use as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol aims to maintain **KDOLLAR**'s peg to 1 **KRONOS** in the long run.

* **KDOLLAR Shares ($KSHARE)** - **KDOLLAR** Shares (**KSHARE**) are one of the ways to measure the value of the **KDOLLAR** Protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to maintain **KDOLLAR** close to peg. During epoch expansions the protocol mints **KDOLLAR** and distributes it proportionally to all **KSHARE** holders who have staked their tokens in the Boardroom (Masonry ). **KSHARE** has a maximum total supply of 70000 tokens distributed as follows:&#x20;
  1. Team Allocation: 7000 KSHARE vested linearly 12 months&#x20;
  2. DEV Allocation: 2500 TSHARE vested linearly over 12 months&#x20;
  3. Remaining 59500 TSHARE are allocated for incentivizing Liquidity Providers in two shares pools for 12 months

* **KDOLLAR** Bonds (**KBOND**) main job is to help incentivize changes in **KDOLLAR** supply during an epoch contraction period. When the **TWAP** (Time Weighted Average Price) of **KDOLLAR** falls below 1 **KRONOS**, **KBOND**s are issued and can be bought with **KDOLLAR** at the current price. Exchanging **KDOLLAR** for **KBOND** burns **KDOLLAR** tokens, taking them out of circulation (deflation) and helping to get the price back up to 1 **KRONOS**. These **KBOND** can be redeemed for **KDOLLAR** when the price is above peg in the future, plus an extra incentive for the longer they are held above peg. This amounts to inflation and sell pressure for **KDOLLAR** when it is above peg, helping to push it back toward 1 **KRONOS**.

The Bomb Money protocol works through a synergistic design of unique tokens and mechanisms that create an automatic, self-reinforcing system to help maintain the peg (10,000 BOMB = 1 Bitcoin). Each of these tokens and mechanisms will be explained in further detail within this documentation, but for now let's have a look at a brief overview of how it all works:

* When **BOMB price is over the peg**, new BOMB are minted by the protocol to inflate the supply in an attempt to drive the price down towards the peg. These new BOMB are allocated to BSHARE holders in the Boardroom, as a reward for their investment and trust in the protocol. This in turn increases the demand for and the value of BSHARE.
* When **BOMB price is at the peg**, no new BOMB will be minted, keeping the supply fixed during this time. Since there will be no new supply coming in, the peg will be maintained indefinitely at this point unless there is a shift in demand. More buying pressure during this time will push the price back up above the BOMB minting threshold. Conversely, more selling pressure will push the price below the peg.
* When **BOMB price drops below the peg**, the protocol will begin to mint BBONDs (up to a maximum debt limit). Experienced investors will have the ability to exchange their BOMB for these BBOND, which they can then redeem for BOMB at a premium above peg in the future. This removes BOMB from the total supply, applying upward pressure on the price towards the peg. Besides this, investors who believe in the protocol's ability to maintain peg can just buy BOMB to essentially purchase Bitcoin at a discount to the market. Both of these incentives are intended to create upward pressure on BOMB's price when under the peg so that the peg can be regained over time. BOMB staking (xBOMB), and other features of the protocol that will be discussed later, also help limit BOMB supply and apply upward pressure on the price during this time.

There are so many different ways you can utilize the mechanisms of the Bomb Money protocol to earn yield. Pick a strategy that is right for you, based upon your own knowledge and experience. Even the most simple and basic of strategies can earn great returns, but feel free to experiment with more complex strategies as you learn how the protocol works!

## What exactly is the peg?

BOMB is a token that is intended to track the price of Bitcoin (BTC) algorithmically. The ratio for this peg is set at 10,000 BOMB to 1 BTC. BOMB **actively tracks this peg via an algorithm**, but that **does not mean** it will be valued at 10,000 BOMB to 1 BTC at all times as **it is not collateralized**. **BOMB is not to be confused for a crypto or fiat-backed stablecoin.**

The entire design of the Bomb Money protocol is intended to try and maintain this peg as closely as possible, but as it is an algorithmic peg, this will never be a completely stable process. In fact, some of the unique profit-generating opportunities offered by the protocol actually only exist because of these price fluctuations.

To put it simply, there will **almost certainly be times when the price of BOMB is below peg**. This is a natural part of the process, and opens up opportunities for active investors/traders to "buy the dip" and help support the protocol by regaining peg, while also profiting from the discounted price.

When the protocol is healthy and stable, the price of BOMB will likely look similar to above, with price fluctuating above and below peg as the mechanisms of the protocol work to influence supply and demand and maintain an average price around the peg.

Keep this in mind when developing your strategies and when taking a more active role in the protocol.
