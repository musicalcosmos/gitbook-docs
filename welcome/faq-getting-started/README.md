# Getting Started

### **What do I need to get started with Bomb Money?**

First, please make sure to read the [**introduction**](../../) if you haven't already so that you can truly understand the concepts behind Bomb Money and how they work before you invest in it.

Second, as always, with anything in crypto itâ€™s wise to keep the following rules in mind:

* Never invest more than you are comfortable with.
* Do your own research.
* Diversify your risks.
* Take your initial investment out when in profit to secure your capital.

Once you are ready to take the next step it's time to figure out how to bridge your funds to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) if you don't already have investable funds there. Let's go through the entire process step-by-step, and feel free to skip through any parts you already understand.

We _highly_ recommend reading **all** of the documentation before participating in the Bomb Money protocol. Not only will it benefit you, but it will benefit the entire ecosystem when the protocol is being used correctly by a fully educated user base. You'll be glad you did!
