# Provide KDOLLAR/KSHARE LP

In order to provide Liquidity, we first have to purchase either KDOLLAR or KSHARE (have a look at our "How to buy KDOLLAR section if you need help in doing so), depending on which you want to provide liquidity for.

Providing liquidity is possible on [KronosDao](https://farms.kronosdao.ai/add). Head over to the Liquidity tab on the left side of your screen. Connect your wallet (Make sure your Metamask is on the BSC Network). Now you have to choose Ingredient A and B. Ingredient A will be KRONOS and ingredient B will either be KDOLLAR or KSHARE.

If KDOLLAR  or KSHARE do not show up, please copy/paste the address shown below manually.

**KDOLLAR** :&#x20;

**KSHARE**:&#x20;

Click on supply and accept the transaction in your wallet.

Now that you have provided LP, you can head over to [KronosBoard ](https://board.kronosdao.ai/cemetry)and farm your LP's.
