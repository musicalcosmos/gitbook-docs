# Genesis Pool (First 24hrs)

In the first 48hrs of launch 69120GRAPE tokens (1440/hr) will be released to pool stakers.

We intend to keep the pools protocol specific and will only offer only WBNB and USDC staking.

These pools will be up for the whole 48hrs. Around halfway through the initial 48hr period we will add the KDOLLAR/BNB LP token pool to allow stakers to begin adding LP liquidity. Weightings will be evenly split between WBNB and USDC pools for the first 12hrs then will change to 10% each when we add the KDOLLAR/BNB LP pool. The LP pool will have 80% weighting for the remainder of the initial 24hrs.

**Pools:** WBNB, USDC, KDOLLAR/BNB LP&#x20;

**Weightings:** WBNB(50% for first 12hr then 10% after), USDC(50% for first 12hr then 10% after), KDOLLAR/BNB LP (80%)

**Total GRAPE tokens:**  69120
